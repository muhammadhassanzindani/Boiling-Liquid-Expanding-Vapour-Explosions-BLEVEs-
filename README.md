# Boiling-Liquid-Expanding-Vapour-Explosions-BLEVEs-
Completed Machine Learning project on predictive analysis for the peak pressure generated by (BLEVEs) 2024. The project involved collecting and preprocessing data from various sources, conducting exploratory data analysis, and developing predictive models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.  I optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and evaluated them using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R2 scores. The models were interpreted using SHAP values and partial dependency plots. The outcome was a set of highly accurate predictive models, providing valuable insights for improving safety measures in industries handling hazardous materials. The project showcased my proficiency in Python, machine learning tools, and data visualization.
